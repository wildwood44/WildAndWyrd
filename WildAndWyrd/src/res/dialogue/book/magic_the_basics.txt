1$ None$ Magic is the mystical force birthed by nature and granted by ghosts, fae and mystical beasts that inhabit Albion and the land of the fae. It is a product of nature that gives life to impossible fauna, which in turn grants spells typically to those who give back to their maker. Use it to command the natural forces or make a thing that isn’t there. Perhaps bestow it on to another be it a blessing or a curse. Or maybe give an item motion or change its natural form. Utilize it with a wand and staff to bring out new possibilities or brew magical and non-magical materials to make a special potion.
