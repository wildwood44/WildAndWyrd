1$ None$ One of the earliest questions I had for myself when storyboarding for the game was if humans are persecuted in this world how did Alder survive growing up. For his character, Alder needed to grow up amongst humans and the typical woodland creatures to make him comfortable when he interacts with either. The concept was for him to be a wanderer but this was scrapped as it would be unlikely for him to survive on the move. This led to the decision that he needed a stationary but isolated location to grow up. During this process, the concepts for the characters Florace and Kyla were added giving him company. 
2$ None$ To keep the cottage secret it needed to be concealed in case anyone came across it which made Kyla into a witch who used magic to hide the structure.
